# Software Engineering portfolio week 2

## Cloning of the shared github
 in visual studio press git tab and clone repository. This screen will be showed:
 ![clone shared repo](https://github.com/euan-maccoll/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/images/cloning_repo.png)  
 in the repository location field enter the location of the repository you want to clone in this case
 its "https://github.com/timh1975/UNDAC-App-Project". 
 To know if this has successfully worked in the bottom right of visual studio where your github repository is 
 for me it currently displays "SoftwareEngineering" if you click it, it should display the repositorys that 
 can be changed to.

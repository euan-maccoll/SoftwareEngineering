# Software Engineering portfolio week 2

## Cloning of the shared github
 in visual studio press git tab and clone repository. This screen will be showed:
 ![clone shared repo](https://github.com/euan-maccoll/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/images/cloning_repo.png)  
 in the repository location field enter the location of the repository you want to clone in this case
 its "https://github.com/timh1975/UNDAC-App-Project". This limits the group project and portfolio as the current useable 
 github repositories to only two.
 To know if this has successfully worked in the bottom right of visual studio where your github repository is 
 for me it currently displays "SoftwareEngineering" if you click it, it should display the repositorys that 
 can be changed to.

 The repos ive cloned are the group project repo and my personal portfolio repository. when trying to push the changes 
 to the repository the file wouldnt be pushed because the remote name was different from the main branch name on github.

## Instilation of visual studio 
for the installation of visual studio i downloaded the installer from microsoft azure after selecting visual studio
to be downloaded, after running the installer for visual studio you have the options between the available versions.

extensions to be added i selected the python, Azure development, ASPNET and web development with this visula studio will be limited
as it wont be able to use the node.js extension currently but could be used to develop python programs.
